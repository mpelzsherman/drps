<h3>Is My Practice Right for You?</h3> My practice builds meaningfully
on my prior skills as a classroom teacher, manager, researcher, artist,
massage therapist, and designer of award-winning interactive technology
based health education. I offer solution oriented and creative problem
solving approaches that combine the art of psychotherapy with the
clarity of a scientist. As the parent of three, including twins
diagnosed with autism, I offer a unique family centered approach
integrating developmental psychology with relationship based
psychotherapy.

<h3>Philosophy of Service</h3> My goal is to assist individuals in
examining the obstacles that prevent them from making meaningful
changes, learning emotional skills, and from living life more fully. I
offer a customized coaching model that builds on your values and goals, 
and offers new psychological experiences and tools.
My approach to therapy is to facilitate healing and growth, explore
insights, to support
transitions. </div> <div class='image-sidebar'><img

<h2>Introduction</h2> I am delighted that you found your way to my
website for this introduction to my clinical services, background,
research, publications and specializations. <p><p>

<p>My approach to therapy is to facilitate your growth, to support you
in transitions, offer you tools, guidance and knowledge as you explore
insights, evolving roles, and new feelings. My goal is to assist you in
examining the obstacles which prevent you from making meaningful
changes, from learning, and from living your life more fully. <br/><br/>
A variety of psychotherapy services are available at my practice. I see
individuals, couples and small groups and present psychoeducational
topics to the community, and provide consulting to businesses. <br/><br/> I offer social skills groups for
children and psychoeducational groups for adults. Inspired by the work
of Michelle Garcia Winner, Carol Gray, Tony Attwood and others, and
building on a foundation of teaching experience, I lead participants
through activities that have been shown to improve social thinking and
social behavior. <br/><br/> I serve as a volunteer advisor for
Postpartum Education and Support (PES), a non-profit group working to
help new parents. As a Community
Emergency Rescue Team, or CERT instructor, I teach <i>Disaster
Psychology</i> through the Cary and Raleigh Fire Departments and other
regional groups. I volunteer as a guest speaker on requested topics for Autism Society of Raleigh.</div> <div class='image-sidebar'> <img

As the parent of three, including twins diagnosed with
autism, I offer a unique family-centered approach that integrates
developmental psychology with relationship-based psychotherapy, building on
my 30 years of experience working with families in a variety of capacities.

<p>TEACHING &amp; HEALTH TECHNOLOGY: Native American, African American, Hispanic,
Moslem, Jewish, and Asian are among the communities I joined as a credentialed teacher. 
My heath technolgy work began with a masters degree from San
Diego State University in Interdisciplinary Studies/Media Psychology, after  which
I led the design & production teams in the
development of premiere award winning health education CDs and websites
for Mayo Clinic, Hazelton, St. Jude Hospital, Health Partners,
Taking Control of Your Health (adults), and BodyLand/Time Life
(children), and McGraw Hill's Health & Biology CD
textbooks. Do you want a therapist who is passionate about health and education working for you?<p>

<p>TRAINING &amp; RESEARCH: Clinics, neuropsych offices, corporate research 
and schools are among the training environments that have prepared me to partner with
you as a highly trained professional. Original research, advanced training,
and my specific skills are built in part on the mentorship received by Dr. Henry Soper, 
Dr. Debra Bendell, Dr. Barbara Kalmanson, Dr. Erik Gregory, Dr. Barbara Still and Dr. Barbara Turner.

<p>INTEGRATIVE APPROACH: My practice style builds meaningfully on my
prior skills as teacher, manager, researcher, artist, massage therapist,
and designer of interactive technology-based health education. I offer
solution-oriented and creative problem solving approaches that combine
the art of psychotherapy with the clarity of a scientist.<br> <br></p>

<p> <p> WHO UNDERSTANDS? Raising a
child with High Functioning Autism can sometimes feel like an upside
down inside out experience. As a parent raising two, along side a third
child with ADHD, I get it. When my twins were diagnosed in 1999, I could
have carried the books about autism at the local Raleigh bookstore under
one arm. Today, I could not push the shelves that hold them all! I can
help you sort through the many possibilities to develop your own tools and
style. Together we can create a plan with solid footing in research, but
is not one-size fits all. As Tony Atwood points out, there is as much
diversity of character on the spectrum, as there is in the rest of the
population.<p>

<p> WHAT ABOUT SCHOOL? Have you seen the book, <i>Autism: Asserting
Your Child's Right to a Special Education?</i> Come in and take a look, I
wrote the assessment chapter to help families navigate the school
experience. Having been a teacher myself, I think kids should do
more than just survive, they should thrive! <p> IS YOUR CHILD EVER
MOODY? My 2009 research examined well-being and depression among
children and adolescents. They say it can take over a decade for
research to get from the journals all the way to a family. I don’t think
families want to wait that long.

<p> IN THE COMMUNITY: As my children grew I heard more stories of
unfortunate encounters (innocent) kids were having with law enforcement,
and I became interested in prevention. That interest led to co-authoring
<i>Special Difficulties of Autism Spectrum Disorders in the Forensic
Arena</i> (2010) which was published in Handbook of Forensic
Neuropsychology, 2nd ed. New York: Springer Verlag. Social safety is a
important at all ages. Until law enforcement professionals understand autism, 
we'll need to
bridge the knowledge gap through information and education provided to teens and young adults.

<p> PUBLIC SPEAKING: Do you know a group that would like to learn more about
autism? Contact me to learn about informal or formal talks, facilitated discussions, and other ways 
that my practice can assist you, your organization, school or family. Information can change lives.

<h2>Tools for Healthy Mind-Body Living</h2>
<p>Tools For Healthy Mind-Body Living is the branch of my practice that integrates media psychology, research in multi-cultural learning styles and cognitive differences as well as behavior modification principles with current theories and best practices for the coaching of parenting and partnering. 
I will create individualized visual and customized audio support as well as other supports- 
to assist you in meeting your unique goals. The combination of my training as a 
psychotherapist and as a curriculum designer delivers the tool set you need 
to reach your highest potential in relief, healing or change.<p>

I find that the fundamentals of sleep, eating, and time management are synergistically related to mental health and personal growth. Each effects the other, and for some individuals, art, music, and technology can also be utilized therapeutically  to improve the quality of life and relationships. To support your healing, well-being and personal growth, I have carefully selected tools which have already been incorporated into my therapeutic and coaching model for many years. The items shown here are available at my office in Raleigh. What are you struggling to manage in your life? There might be a tool that can help.

<h2>Sound Machine</h2>
<p>
Although experts can disagree on many topics, most of us can agree that children and adults alike function better with a good nights sleep. There are many devices on the market today that offer nature sounds and white noise. After researching sleep for Dr. Corrine Goodwinâ€™s project, I have selected this device to support the clinical needs of the individuals and families in my practice. Innovative technology is utilized to create soothing, natural sounds that effectively mask out unwanted noise that may interfere with your ability to sleep, relax, meditate or concentrate on work or studies. This mother of five offers the following testimonial:

<div class="testimonial">"We LOVE our sound machines. We have four! One for each bedroom upstairs. If not for the sound machines, my kids would definitely be waking each other during the night and also possibly waking from sounds in the house and outside the house (airplanes, car horns, loud cars, dogs barking). I think it helps them sleep in later in the morning due to not hearing these noises, plus it is very soothing so it helps them fall asleep at night. I am completely addicted to mine, I cannot sleep without it. On our recent trip, we brought 3 along with us! It is also very comforting for the baby - she knows it is nap/night time when I take her into her room and she hears it. So, as you can tell - we are very happy with these sound machines - these particular ones really are the only ones to get - it is a deep soothing sound that really blocks out background noise."</div>

<div class='content'> <h2>Parent-Infant Wellness Care</h2>

<p>HELP IS HERE: I understand the unique challenges faced by parents and
those wanting to become parents. Your marriage, level of trust and
self-confidence can all be disrupted during times of unexpected change,
or expected and welcomed change. My unique family-centered approach is
based on years of working with parents in a variety of teaching and
therapeutic roles. I invite you to come to my office and learn more
about the range of services I can offer to support the changes you seek,
the decisions you face, or the healing you desire.   <p>

<p>CREDENTIALS & EXPERIENCE: My doctoral level training 
includes a specialization in Parent-Infant Mental Health
supported by neuropsychology training. This prepares me
to help you through the natural stress often experienced during 
adjustment to birth, loss, adoption, infertility, or the birth of
multiples.  <p>

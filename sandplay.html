<body> <div class='content'> <h2>Sandplay Therapy </h2>
<p> Dr. Pelz-Sherman, PhD, CST is a certified Sandplay Therapist with Sandplay Therapists of America (STA)
and the International Association for Sandplay Therapy (ISST).<p>


<p><em>Sandplay is for individuals of all ages who seek healing or
personal growth.</em></p>
<p>ABOUT/HISTORY: Sandplay is creative form of therapy with a long and
distinguished history. In the 1930's London pediatrician Margaret
Lowenfield developed a model for integrating the basic tools of
sandplay: the tray filled with sand and the collection of miniatures.
Dora Kalff, a Jungian analyst who studied with Lowenfield, developed
Sandplay Therapy: a combination of Lowenfield's original technique and
Jungian psychology. Sandplay Therapy, which is grounded in Jung's
theories about psychology and symbolism, can be adapted for both adults
and children. Sandplay therapy has become widely used in schools,
hospitals and clinics and today is practiced all over the world.</p>

<p> I presented at the Sandplay Therapists of America New Mexico Conference 
in 2013 on adult sandplay, and was invited to teach a session on technology 
in the study of sandplay. In 2012 I presented on Autism and Sandplay with 
Dr. Stephen Olmsted at the STA
Conference in Berkeley, California.

<p>CERTIFICATION: Formal STA certification in Sandplay requires years of advanced study, 
presentation, consultation, travel, writing and a substantial financial investment. The inspiration to pursue advanced training grew out of witnessing the effectiveness and potent capacities of this treatment modality. Come visit my practice to learn about what Sandplay and expressive therapies
 may be able to offer you.

 Licensed therapists who are interested in completing a sandplay process in 
 order to become qualified to pursue training with STA/ISST are eligible to 
 work with me, based on my Certification level.
